Here is a short video of a computer vision task I have been working on. It includes object detection, image segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. 


Object Classification was done with Ultrlytics Yolov8-Nano.
Image Segmentation and Depth estimation was performed via Hugging Face with "nvidia/segformer-b0-finetuned-ade-512-512" and “Intel/dpt-hybrid-midas”.
